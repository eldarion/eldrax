eldrax README
=============

eldrax is a Python library for interacting with Rackspace APIs. This project has
been extracted from libraries used internally at [Eldarion](http://eldarion.com/)
on the [Gondor](https://gondor.io/) project.

Rationale
---------

In Eldarion's opinion the Rackspace libraries for Python currently available
simply do not meet our standards. We wanted a great API and excellent Python
support.

Status
------

This project has been extracted from working code in [Gondor](https://gondor.io/).
However, we've been removing lots of cruft and improving the API even more! The
code is not 100% complete nor does it cover all the services Rackspace provides
yet. We are working on extracting more code and making it complete.
